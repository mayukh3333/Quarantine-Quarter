//TODO: there's a discrepancy in the notch support for the sports app
//due to topbar is transparent, but header gets extra height, but collectionview elements not...
//probably best is remove feature_notch..

//OAUTH REDIRECT
We need that the redirect url is a custom scheme, universal links do not work unlesss is triggered by a user.
Maybe could work a redirect html page, that has a button than the user click on it to return to the app, but need to have the return code, etc..
The easier is use custom scheme url, the redirect url could be overwritten in the AuthManager class
On the previewer we setup two custom url one for the previewer auth0 login
and the other for the auth login, not sure which one will be better to use...

for strava the redirect url is checked for domain, not scheme, so it's ok to use custom scheme url

cases covered
- user authenticates, change app, oauths should be saved
- user authenticates, kill the app, oauths are not there, but will be rebuilt on loadApp

need to fix
- user authenticates, remove app, keychain need to be removed on start again!!!
- tokens need to be refreshed before each api call

- refreshtoken on auth0
expiresIn check, as is not modified when trying to force refresh tokens
